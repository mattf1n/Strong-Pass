# Strong-Pass
Strong password generator extension for Chrome-based browsers.

## Usage
1. Clone this repository.
2. Visit [chrome://extensions](chrome://extensions) in your browser and ensure that the **Developer mode** checkbox in the top right-hand corner is checked.
3. Click **Load unpacked extension** and select the cloned repository.

## Why use this?
I really appreciate Google Chrome's built-in strong password suggester. Unfortunately, this feature is not available in Brave browser. Therefore, I made my own. Enjoy!
